            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>And bicauſe this toucheth our mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and the very point thereof: I will ſtand withe the aduerſary the longer.

No no, Goddes ha<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>de is not abbrid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by the terms of this liefe. Late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentaunce can be a benefite to no man: God forbed it ſhoulde. Eſpecially ſeing pooniſhement and iudgement for ſin (as many learned doo ſuppoſe, and as rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon withe ſcripture bearethe) properly apperteineth not to this worlde, but by
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:183:33"/> a ſpeciall grace, and ſingulare benefite, whiche God of peety graunteth to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che as he louethe, that they may here praeuent his angre: whiche elles in the nexte lyefe ſhoulde be found more greuous, wher properly is the reward of ſinne, and iudgement kept ordinarily for the ſame.

               <p>Well then, to cloſe vp brefely, all this haue we fownde by theſe ſcriptures al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaged: that being diuerſe degrees off men, Purgatory apperteineth but to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne ſort.

<pb facs="tcp:183:85"/> to ſuche as haue not builded vpon the foundation, but rather defaced it withe woorkes of deathe and deueliſhe do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine. For all theſe muſt lyke widdred branches be caſt in to the fiere, not to be purged, but vtterly waſted. There be yet other that kepe theire foundation faſte, and woorke there vpon bothe goulde and ſiluer, but yet abaſed and ſumwhat defiled by the mixture of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther infirmityes not ſufficiently redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in this lyefe: theſe muſt of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity by Goddes ordinaunce, ſuffer the Purgation by fire: that theire woorkes purifyed and amended by the ſentence of his iuſte iudgement, may at lengthe by mercy and grace bringe theyme to their deſired end.</p>
               <p>Nowe the perfect eſtate, whiche, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uing this groundewarcke, and building thereuppon nothing for the moſt part, but the tried fyne workes of heauenly doctrine and perfect charity, can not fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>are the fyre, as in whome it ſhall finde no matter of waſte. For if any droſſe of

               <p>Theſe therefore thus guarded by goddes grace, in whom onely they cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenge this Priuilege, can not feele anye daunger, theire woorkes (as S.

<pb facs="tcp:183:86"/> Churche, that they go ſtreght to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uen vpon theire departure, with owte ſtay or pooniſhement in the next liefe. Althoughe Chriſte onely, of his owne force, being not ſubiecte to any ſpotte of ſinne, did paſſe this fyre: and entre in to heauen, the aeternall gates opening theime ſelues vnto him as to the king of glory. Who being before in the pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of paine alſo,<note place="margin">

               <p>And that is S.

<pb n="86" facs="tcp:183:86"/> fyre.</p>
               <p>But for thoſe that be in dede perfect menne, as Iohn the beloued of Ieſus, and Petre with the reſt, this holy do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctoure was ſo ſure of Purgatory, that he thought theſe alſo to go throughe the ſame: and yet the fiery flamme to haue geue<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> place as it did to the three childre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>, and as S.

               <p>All beit I doo not ſay that the fyry ſworde is in the paſſage of euery ſoule towardes heauen, for that is Goddes ſecret: and I will with S. Ambroſe in the ſame place ſay: <hi>Quod legi praeſumo,</hi>

Theſe wordes as yowe ſee, expreſſely prooue oure matter, open the meaning of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture whereon we nowe ſtoode, and doo clearely ſett forth the ordre of Goddes iuſtice in the next lyefe. And they ſhall content the reader better, if he marke vpon what occaſion this bleſſed man ſpake theſe wordes. There were many in the perſecution of that tyme, that for feare or worldly reſpectes, denyed theire faithe, and offered to idolles:
<pb facs="tcp:183:94"/> who afterward, the ſtorme off tyranny ſomwhat being caulmed, co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>feſſed their faulte, and did penaunce for the ſame, by S.

By whome, after due ſatiſfaction made, they were admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to the communion of the Chriſtian company, and receite of the holy ſacra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ageyne. But all paſtours not off lyke mercy or ſeuerity in the caſe, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me were ſuſpended from the vſe of the Sacraments longer, and otherſom by more clemency with ſpede pardoned ageine. Nowe S. Ciprian, thoughe he were very ſeuere in ſuche a cauſe, (as in all his workes it dooth wel appeare) yet he was blamed by Antonyanus and others, that he dealte ouer mekely with ſuche as denyed theire faithe, in ſo ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy admiſſion of thime to the peace of Goddes church, as they then termed that reconciliation: alleaging, that iff ſuche wordely wynd wauerers might be admitted ſo ſoone after thopen de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niall

But S. Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prians anſwer is this: that theire admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion can not withdrawe any mannes zele from martyrdom, or confeſsion of Chriſtes name, ſeeing theire reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tion dothe not ſet theime on ſo cleare bord as martyrs be, Who being tried by theire bloud ſhall ſtreght receiue the croune of glory: When the others ſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding but vpon pardon of theire ſinnes, and not diſcharged of due paines for the ſame, muſt into priſon notwithſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, til they haue paide their vttermoſt duety: and by longe amending by fyre, at the laſt coom to that reward, which the martyrs atteined by ſufferance att the firſt.<note place="margin">Marke vvell.</note> And thus I thinke this holy Martyr meaneth.

For there is a ſtate of life that is nether ſo perfect but it may well haue neede of theſe helpes after deathe, nor yet ſo very euill, but ſuche thinges may well ſuccour theime after theire departure.

So if thowe woulde knowe whether that place that our aduerſaries impudently doo allea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge oute of Gregory the greate, ageinſt the ſoueraignty of the ſee of Roome, was in deede written for theire ſediti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſe, behoulde the practiſe of
<pb n="197" facs="tcp:183:197"/> the ſame father, and thowe ſhalte finde him ſelfe exerciſe iuriſdiction, at the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſame time when he wrote it, in all prouincies Chriſtianed throughe owte the worlde: both by excommunication of biſſhoppes that gouerned not well, by often citation of perſons in extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me prouincies, by many appeales ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de vnto him, by continuall legacies to other nations, ſent ether to conuerte theime to the faithe, or to gouerne in theire doubtfull affaires, and by al other exerciſe of ſpirituall iuriſdiction. Is itt not nowe a very faulſe ſuggeſtion to the poore people, that this bleſſed man in ſo plaine vtterau<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ce of his meaning by workes and not by woordes, ſhould yet be brought as a witneſſe to condemne him ſelfe? thoughe the wordes being well vnderſtand make for no ſuch mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in deede, as by others it hath bene ſufficientlye declared. The like impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencie it is, to alleage S. Bernarde aga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſt the Maſſe or the praeſence of Chriſt in the bleſſed Sacrament. Good man I
<pb facs="tcp:183:198"/> dare ſay for him, he ſayde Maſſe euery daye, if he were well at eaſe: For other buſines, did not commonly let theyme in thoſe daies, fro<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> that work of al other moſt neceſſarie. So the reciting oute of S.

Therefore I

Let him fay wher he liſt: this man or that man was the firſt that euer praide for the deade in Chriſtes churche: if I can not ſhewe an other before him ſo named, to haue praide allſo, we will take him for the firſt author, and then he fully ſtoppeth oure courſe that we can not bring this obſeruation ſo highe as the Apoſtles
<pb facs="tcp:183:245"/> dayes. But if the aduerſary can apoint me owte no time nor perſon that began this vſage, before which I am not hable to proue it was practiſed, then they can not let vs but we muſt needes driue it vpward, to the apoſtles and Chriſtes owne inſtitution. Yf they anſwer me, that this vſage is crept in to the church ſith the Apoſtles time, thoughe the fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſte author can not be knowne: I wil al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo prouide, that there no ſhift ſhall ſerue theim. Therfore I aſke theime whether that man which firſt preached it, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted by the reſt of Goddes churche which before his preaching belieued the contrarie, or no? That is it ſay, this doctrine of prayng for the deade when it firſt came in to the churche, did any of the true paſtors free from the ſame error, barke like a good ſheperd againſt the beginner of that, which they cownt ſo greate a corruption of trueth? Or all the Church was corrupted with it on one daye? ſay what yowe thinke likeſt in this caſe, anſwer with any probability
<pb n="244" facs="tcp:183:245"/> or reaſon if yow can ſay plainely, was oure doctrine euer preached ageinſte, or neuer? if it neuer wer preached again<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſte, then it neuer began as any noueltye or newe doctrine? For it coulde not be that the Church being free from that doctrine, ſhoulde ſtreght withe owte contradiction alowe that, whiche they lyked not before. Howe can any man ariſe in the commonwelth, and bring the vtter decay of all the oulde ordres whiche he findethe, and erecte vppe a newe deuiſe of his owne, and neuer man ſpeake a worde againſt him, but al in one moment allowe and lyke the ſame, and that with owte all recorde by memory or monument of any chaung? But this thinge is moſt farre from the Churchies and Goddes paſtors dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, that neuer receiued faulſe doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne withoute oppen contradiction, and plaine noting the party that firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan it, as we ſhall plucke our gentleme<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> by the ſlieue a none. All thoſe that haue any ſkyl in the antiquitie, wil beare me
<pb facs="tcp:183:246"/> recorde, that the paſtors did neuer houl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de theire peace when any wolfe did but once oppen his mouthe ageinſte the ſheepe. They can tell, that ſhe did neuer beare the preaching or practiſe of any faulſe and erronious doctrine for one day together<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then it muſt needes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently folowe, that the doctrine off purgatory and oblation for the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with ſtill conſent of all nations re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiued in the Catholyke Churche, had no beginning after the firſte inſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our faith and woorſhip of god, but hathe ioyned from the firſte gro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wnde of oure Chriſtian inſtitution in Chriſtes faithe, with that ſacrifice and due honour off God which the apoſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>les by the ſugeſtion of the holy goſt pla<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>ted in al nations with the ſame faith. Thus I make my argume<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>t:<note place="margin">Note.</note> euery faulſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood was preached againſt, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanded when it is firſte entered, but this doctrine of purgatory and praying for the deade being alwaies vſed, was neuer controwled, nor gainſaide in god<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>des
<pb n="245" facs="tcp:183:246"/> churche therfore it is no faulſhood, nor euer hadd any later inſtitution then the Apoſtles owne preſcription. But what needes all this a doo? by their owne conſent we ſhall drieue this do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrine thirtene c. yeres vpwarde. For ſo neare was Tertulian the Apoſtles da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yes, whome they confeſſe to haue pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctiſed that pointe of oblations for the deade. And aſke him where he had it (for ſurely he inuented it not him ſelfe) and he appointeth vs to his forfathers:<note place="margin">De corona militis.</note> he namethe the Apoſtles for the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and fownders therof, as of many other thinges, which he there reakene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the beſide, that were generally receiued, and nowe be of haeretikes likewiſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temned. We might yet ſteppe ij.c. yeare forwarde, and finde emongeſt the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles oun hearers, the ſame doctrine bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>the allowed and practiſed, but that they will make exception of Dyoniſius and Clements woorkes (ſuche ſhiftes men muſt finde that will defend faulſhood) Other I wil name, that be owte of thei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re
<pb facs="tcp:183:247"/> exceptions. Who I thinke as wel for theire time, knouledge, and credit, as theyre excellent vertue, bothe can and wil better tel the origin of that thing, the authors whereof were more nigh theyre tyme then oures. If they woulde beleue S. Auguſt, as they often profeſſe they will, the matter might ſoone be ended: but bicauſe I feare they ſtand ſo muche in the corrupt conceite of their owne ſingularitie, that they wil be bold to reiect him, I ſhall both lay him to theire charges and diuerſe other of greater antiquitye that ſhall in expreſſe words affirme this vſage to coom from the Apoſtles owne ſchoole. That ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by they may ether acknouledg their er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rours, or elles by ſuch graue and vncor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt iudgies, be condemned of willfull malitious blindneſſe.<note place="margin">Ser. <hi>32.</hi> de ver.

<pb n="260" facs="tcp:183:261"/> For that, the notation of his ariſing and name, was not onely a warning to the preſent time to take heede to theire faithe, but an admonition to all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteritye to beware of the lyke. And it was euer counted a refutation of an hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſye to the full, to reduce it to a latter infamous author, by the certaine recor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de of the churchies hiſtorie.

In this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſpake Irenaeus. But the ruele is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and certaine as any can be in the worlde, and I woulde ſtand vpon the grounde therof againſt all faulſe doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne in the worlde,<note place="margin">A general rule to knovve haereſi by.</note> and thus it is: Any opinion, that may be truely fathered vpon any priuate man, that was longe after the trueth was firſt preached by the apoſtles, if it be vpon a point of our faithe, and contentiouſly mainteyned, it is an haereſye. And thus againe: who ſo euer was withſtand in his firſt ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and preaching, by ſuche as were in the vnitye of the Churche, he was a faulſe teacher, and his abettours be heretikes. And the force of this conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is ſo greate, that the heretikes thei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>me ſelues if they can get any likly ſhew of rayſing of any doctrine, or practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of goddes Churche in theſe latter
<pb n="261" facs="tcp:183:262"/> daies, they thinke they haue a good ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument againſt the Catholikes. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they would father tranſubſtantia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion vpo<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> this Councel, the adoratio<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g> of the Sacrament vpon that Pope, indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies vpon that biſſhop, &amp;c.

And yet when they haue traueled to theire heartes ake, they can find no one thing firſt inuented by any of theim, whome they faulſely name to be the authors therof. But well ſeeing it is ſo ſtronge an argument of haereſye, to haue the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of a later author, with plane pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uiſò of goddes Churche for his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinge, let vs adde ſo muche ſtre<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>gthe to oure cauſe, to haue the father of the co<g ref="char:cmbAbbrStroke">̄</g>

For I neuer readde of, nor yet knew any he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retike, but if he once miſtruſted the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholike Church, the Deuil was hable to perſwade withe him as well in a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bre

How Lorde lyke Maſter Grin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dall made his Argument here? Where he ſhoulde plainely haue inferred the contrarye after this ſorte. There was no ſin ſo ſmaule vnpardoned, but there was ſum ſacrifice of releaſe or expiation the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reof in the owlde lawe, <hi>ergo</hi> if any man weere bounde with ſin, weere it neuer ſo ſmaule, whether he were alyue or deade, there was ſum appointed purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore. For there is no conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence nor any apparance of right de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, to inferre vpon the naming or reherſall of all ſinnes, the peculiare mentioning or plaine reherſal of ſuche perſons as may be burdened with tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe ſinnes. There were ſacrificies then in the owlde law for weemen as well as men, for the Princies no leſſe then for the poore, for the prieſt and for the people, for the dead as well for the lyue. And where there was no difference nor
<pb n="284" facs="tcp:183:285"/> reſpecte of perſons, in that pointe there was no peculiare mention to be ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de, for the diſtiction of ſtates. The peculiare reherſall therefore, was onely made for the diuerſity of offenſies, and not allwaies for the difference of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. And nowe the departed in faithe being but diſtincted by ſtate of lyfe, and not by bonde of ſin from thoſe that be alyue, muſt needes in the caſe of lyke ſinne, for the vnitye whiche he is in, haue the lyke remedy as the lyeue hath for the ſame ſinne.<note place="margin">Note</note> And therefore to help your ignorance ſum thing, thus yowe muſt learne: that there was no peculiare ſacrifice for the dead, as thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ghe they were not of the common bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy with the liuinge, but they had the ſame ſacrifice doone for theime that the liuing in this worlde in the like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſe of ſin, or pouniſhement for offenſies, had.

And in all other practiſes, there is a perfecte com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munitye of all benefites betwixte the deceaſed and theire bretherne remay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning yet in this worlde. And therefore when yow ſeeke for ſacrifice in the oul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>de law, looke not for any diſtincte wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ye of handeling theire offenſies, which is not common with the lyuing. But conſider what there was practiſed for the releaſe of the ſmaller treſpaſſies, and that was vſed for bothth liue and dead, withoute diſtinction. Marke what ſacri<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>fice was for the abating of any pain due for great offenſies, and the ſame ſhal be well vnderſtande, to be with owte dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference practiſed, for the liue and deade together. That therby we may by good reaſon conclude, ſeeing ſacrifice was then offered for purgation of euery light offenſe, that it was doone for all ſtates of perſons that were ether in this lyfe, or after theire death to be perfe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctelie
<pb n="285" facs="tcp:183:286"/> clenſed from the ſame. Although the facte of Iudas Machabeus be a play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne proufe that there was a common knowne ordre of ſacrifice: for elles ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>we coulde he haue conceyued any ſuch ſacrifice neuer hearde of before? howe could he lymite the valewe of procure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment thereof, by a certaine ſumme for euery ſoule deceaſed? howe coulde he gather in pretence of a thinge neuer v<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed before, the peoples almoſe withe owte theire murmoure or motion the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rein?
